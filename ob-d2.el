;;; Commentary:

;; Org-Babel support for evaluating d2 diagram scripting source code.
;;
;; d2 differs from most standard languages in that:
;;
;; 1) there is no such thing as a "session" in d2
;;
;; 2) we are only going to return results of type "file"
;;
;; 3) you can specify `:flags' headers to be passed to the `d2' command
;;
;; 4) there are no variables (at least for now)

;;; Requirements:

;; - You must have d2 installed and d2 should be in your `exec-path'. If not,
;;   feel free to modify `ob-d2-command' to the location of your d2
;;   command.
;;
;; - `d2-mode' is also recommended for syntax highlighting and formatting,
;;   however it is not required.

;;; TODO:

;; - Provide better error feedback.
